# You are lazy. That's the feature.

You've corrected your AI the same way a dozen times this week — *"use uv, not
pip"*, *"smaller modules"*, *"stop explaining, just do it"* — and you have
**never once** opened `CLAUDE.md` to write any of it down. Because that's
work, and you have a senior-engineer-grade allergy to work a tool should be
doing for you.

patternity is that tool. It watches the corrections and preferences you keep
repeating, waits until it's sure you mean it, then quietly teaches every AI
assistant you use — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot — to stop making you say it
again.

The arrangement is simple: **you keep being lazy. patternity keeps the
notes.** Nobody hand-maintains a `CLAUDE.md` ever again. You're welcome.

## What you get

- **Zero-effort memory** — corrections and confirmations are captured
  automatically as you work; no "remember this" ritual.
- **It waits before it trusts you** — a preference must *recur* (or be stated
  as a flat "always/never") before it becomes a rule. One grumpy one-off
  won't calcify into law.
- **One brain, every tool** — learned rules compile into `CLAUDE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, Cursor rules, and Copilot instructions, from a single source.
- **You stay in charge (lazily)** — accept/reject from a dashboard, or just
  tell your agent *"reject that."* It's all plain, git-tracked markdown you
  can eyeball or revert.
- **Personal + team** — your preferences follow you across repos; team
  conventions live committed in the repo.

## Install (Claude Code)

```
/plugin marketplace add domudev/patternity
/plugin install patternity@patternity
```

Then just work. After a few sessions, run `/patternity` and watch it write
the `CLAUDE.md` you were never going to.

Cursor / Copilot and the full setup → **[docs/install.md](docs/install.md)**.

## How it works (10-second version)

```
capture  →  noticed → recurring → adopted  →  compile into your tools
```

It notices a preference, waits for it to recur, and once **adopted** compiles
it into your assistants' instructions. No approval gate — every change is a
git diff you can revert. Full walkthrough → **[docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md)**.
