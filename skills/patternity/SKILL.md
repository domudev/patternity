  Learns the user's standing coding preferences so they stop repeating
  themselves, then compiles them into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/.cursor/.github.
  Fire proactively (no command needed) whenever the user states a standing
  preference or repeats a correction ("always", "never", "stop doing", "use A
  not B"); also on "patternity" / "/patternity" / "distill my patterns" and at
  session start. You judge: durable prefs yes, one-offs no.

# patternity

The user is lazy, proudly. They will not hand-write a CLAUDE.md, so you notice
for them.

## When to act

Proactively, mid-conversation, the moment the user states a standing
preference or repeats a correction. Record it then; don't wait for a command.
Restraint is the job: durable, generalizable prefs only. Skip one-offs,
task-specific asks, and anything already fully explicit. When unsure, leave it
at `noticed` rather than calcify a wrong rule (accept/reject and the git diff
are the safety net).

## Store & tools

Personal store: `${PATTERNITY_HOME:-~/.patternity}/patterns/`. Team store (if
the repo has one): `<git-root>/.patternity/patterns/`. Prefer the CLI (keeps
frontmatter valid); run from the plugin dir Claude Code exposes as
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`:

- `patternity.py search "<topic>"` : dedupe before creating.
- `patternity.py add <name> --cluster <c> --agent <claude-code|cursor|copilot> --body "…"` (`--repo` for the team store).
- `patternity.py bump <name>` : +1 occurrence, re-derives state.
- `patternity.py set <name> <field> <value>` (or `--clear`).

Only `name` is required; other fields default. No Python? edit the markdown
directly, same result. Full schema: `patterns/_SCHEMA.md`.

## Ladder & decisions

`occurrences` 1 = `noticed`, 2 = `recurring`, 3+ = `adopted` (compiled). An
explicit "always/never" jumps straight to `adopted`. `decision: accepted`
pins a pattern; `decision: rejected` tombstones it (never compile, never
re-propose, don't resurrect it). To suppress another tool's rule: `type:
override` with `target` set to the verbatim text to remove.

## Reflect

When a pattern reaches `adopted`, run
`uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compile.py"` from the project root
without asking. Give each pattern a `cluster`, and refresh `PROFILE.md` (a
sentence or two of synthesis per cluster, not a re-listing). Commit the store
locally, never push. `index.json`/`index.html` regenerate themselves.

## Reporting

Ledger, not essay. One line per pattern touched (`name: state, n=N`), one line
for what compiled. No preamble, no narrating the files you read, no restating
this. Nothing to do? Say so in one sentence.
